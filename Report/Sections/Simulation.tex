\textcolor{red}{Use the previous model to calculate the transfer function of the ADC (dout(vin))
and compute the transition voltages of the ADC for a given set of errors.}

\textcolor{red}{Use the model to measure the linearity of the ADC using INL, DNL and FFT.}

\textcolor{red}{Run Monte Carlo analysis of the ADC model to determine the sensitivity of the
ADC to mismatch errors between the different components.}

\textcolor{red}{Introduce specific errors into the values of key capacitors in the array (such as CB, Cdl, etc) and observe the resulting impact in the INL and DNL. Observe and explain the effect of the offset voltage on the ADC transfer function. Also compare the difference between using CB=2 or CB=16/15.}

\textcolor{red}{Present a histogram of the linearity of the ADC resulting from the monte carlo analysis. Run this analysis for different magnitude of random errors in the capacitors. Present the best, worst and average INL and DNL from this analysis.}
