\section{Results Analysis}
\label{sec:results}
\textcolor{red}{Compare your results with the results reported in the paper.}

\textcolor{red}{When comparing your results with the paper note that the ADC in the paper has digital correction, which can result in a better performance.}

In this section, we will analyze the results obtained from the simulations and compare them with the results reported in the paper. The analysis will focus on the performance metrics of the ADC, mentioned in the paper.
