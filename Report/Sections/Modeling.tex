\section{Modeling}

\textcolor{red}{Using the previous expression, write a Matlab/Octave model of the behavior of
this SAR ADC, including the offset error of the comparator. Note that the SAR
ADC uses two capacitor arrays (split into LSB and MSB arrays) and fully
differential signals. Include random errors into the capacitors' values and into
the comparator's offset voltage.}

\textcolor{red}{Carefully explain all the relevant parts of your code, including how you obtained the values for the capacitors in the arrays.}

\textcolor{red}{Demonstrate that your code is working correctly, by first presenting the INL and DNL for the case of zero errors in the circuit. Also present the evolution of Vxp and Vxn for each step for a given input voltage.}
